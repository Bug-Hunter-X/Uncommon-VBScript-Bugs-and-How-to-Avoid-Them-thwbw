Addressing Late Binding:
Always explicitly declare object variables and use early binding whenever possible. This improves performance and helps catch errors during compilation rather than at runtime.

```vbscript
Dim objFSO As Object
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

'Check if object creation was successful
if objFSO is nothing then
  msgbox "Failed to create FileSystemObject"
  WScript.Quit
end if

Dim objFile As Object
Set objFile = objFSO.CreateTextFile("myFile.txt", True)
' handle errors here also
```

Handling Implicit Type Conversions:
Be explicit about data types and use functions like CInt, CStr, and CDbl to convert values to the appropriate type before comparisons or calculations.

```vbscript
if CInt("10") = 10 then
  MsgBox "Equal"
else
  MsgBox "Not Equal"
end if
'This will output "Equal"
```

Improving Error Handling:
Avoid relying solely on On Error Resume Next. Instead, use structured error handling with On Error GoTo and specific error checking.

```vbscript
On Error GoTo FileError
Set objFile = objFSO.OpenTextFile("nonExistentFile.txt")
' ... rest of the code
Exit Sub

FileError:
  MsgBox "Error opening file: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End Sub
```
